<h1>Intro Questions</h1>
<body>
    <ol>
        <li>I'm Sean Brosnahan, a sophomore majoring in Communication Design and Economics & Strategy with a minor in Business Analytics.</li>
        <li>I'm from Florida and enjoy playing volleyball in my free time. I am interested in learning more about interaction design for websites and user interfaces. I'm interested in pursuing UX Design so I thought this class would be a good introduction.</li>
        <li>I have experience in Java from CS131, but I don't have experience in HMTL/CSS aside from website builders like Squarespace.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to build and design a functioning website from scratch.</li>
        <li>I expect the interactive and navigation element to be different since designing for paper only involves a visual interaction.</li>
        <li>Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/) exemplifies design because it contains many different features in one interface, such as videos, playlists, and search.</li>
        <li>JM&A Group (https://www.jmagroup.com/) exemplifies communication because it is easy to navigate and clear what information is being conveyed.</li>
        <li>LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/) works well because it combines effective design and communication to create a multifacted platform that is complex yet easy to navigate.</li>
